/*
 * One postgres:18-alpine container for the whole run. See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Testing) for
 * why this rather than a CI `services:` block: it is one path, identical on a
 * laptop and in Actions, and `pnpm test` works on a clean checkout with nothing
 * running but Docker.
 *
 * The migrations are applied once, to a template database. Each test file then
 * clones that template into a database of its own (test/helpers/db.ts), which is
 * what makes files independent — they run in parallel and one file's truncation
 * cannot delete another file's fixtures.
 *
 * Applying the real migrations rather than pushing the schema is deliberate:
 * every run also proves the migration chain still builds a working database,
 * which is the thing the container does at boot.
