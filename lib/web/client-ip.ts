/*
 * The client's address, as far as it can be trusted.
 *
 * Next gives a Route Handler no socket address, so the only source is headers,
 * and a client can send any headers it likes. What it cannot do is control what
 * the proxy *appends*: each proxy adds the address it received the connection
 * from to the right of X-Forwarded-For. With N proxies in front of the app
 * (TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS, default 1), the Nth entry from the right was written by
 * our outermost proxy and is the real client; everything to its left is
 * whatever the client claimed, and is ignored.
 *
 * Behind Cloudflare, set CLIENT_IP_HEADER=cf-connecting-ip — Cloudflare
 * overwrites that header, so it cannot be forged through the tunnel.
 *
 * This decides whether the house guide treats a visitor as "at home"
 * (lib/guide/location.ts), so the hop count must match the deployment. If the
 * app port is also reachable directly on the LAN, a LAN client can forge the
 * header — but a LAN client *is* at home, so nothing is gained.
