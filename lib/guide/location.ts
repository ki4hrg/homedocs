/*
 * "Is this visitor at the house?" — the location gate for codes on the guide.
 *
 * At home means the client address (lib/web/client-ip.ts, which only trusts
 * what our own proxy appended) is inside one of the property's LAN ranges, or
 * equals the home's public address, found by resolving its DDNS hostname. The
 * second covers a phone on the home Wi-Fi reaching the public hostname through
 * the router (hairpin NAT), which is how most housesitters will arrive.
 *
 * It is a convenience, not the only lock: away from home the link's PIN opens
 * the same content. Browser geolocation is deliberately not used — it is
 * asserted by the client, so it would be trivially forged.
