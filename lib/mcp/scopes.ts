/*
 * Authorization at the call, which is the one that counts.
 *
 * Filtering `tools/list` by scope is ergonomics — it keeps a model from planning
 * around a tool it cannot call, which is a real benefit. But a tool list is
 * client-side and can be stale: a conversation that started before a re-grant
 * narrowed its scopes is holding a list that no longer describes what it may do.
 * So the list is the first layer and this is the load-bearing one.
 *
 * And the check is the *intersection*, never the scope alone. A granted
 * homedocs:write does not let a viewer write — the authorize endpoint will not
 * even mint it, and if one ever existed (a demotion after the grant) the role
 * half refuses it here.
