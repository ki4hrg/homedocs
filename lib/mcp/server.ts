/*
 * The MCP server, built per request from the token that authenticated it.
 *
 * Per request rather than per process because there is no MCP session state
 *: every call carries its own credentials, so the tool surface a
 * connection sees is a function of the token in front of it and nothing else. A
 * long-lived server would have to be told which caller it was serving on every
 * message, which is the same work with a shared mutable object in the middle.
 *
 * The low-level Server rather than McpServer, deliberately. McpServer's
 * registerTool is the ergonomic path, but it answers a call to a tool it does
 * not hold with "Tool X not found" and a call to a disabled one with "Tool X
 * disabled" — protocol errors, in a place where MCP.md wants a refusal that
 * names the scope and says reconnecting can grant it. Owning tools/list and
 * tools/call means the list can be filtered *and* the call can answer properly,
 * which is the whole of the two-layer design in that document.
