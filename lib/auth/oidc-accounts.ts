/*
 * Which account a single sign-on identity signs in as (from Biblios).
 *
 * Kept apart from the protocol plumbing in `oidc.ts`: this is the part with the
 * security decisions in it, and it is a function of a claim set and the users
 * table, so it is tested against Postgres with no identity provider at all.
 *
 * In order:
 *
 * 1. **By identity** — the token's `(iss, sub)`. The only key that stays right
 *    when somebody changes their address at the provider. A *removed* account
 *    holding the identity refuses rather than falling through, or removing
 *    somebody would only last until their next sign-in.
 * 2. **By email, once, to link.** An account made with a password has no
 *    identity yet; the first sign-on attaches one. Only on an address the
 *    provider says is verified, or one the deployment trusts
 *    (`OIDC_TRUST_EMAIL`, for an issuer it runs itself) — otherwise anybody who
 *    can assert an address at the provider is handed the account behind it. An
 *    account already carrying a different identity is never re-linked: two
 *    identities claiming one account is a provider reissuing subjects or a
 *    takeover attempt, and neither is for a sign-in to settle.
 * 3. **Otherwise, a new account.** `OIDC_DEFAULT_ROLE` (viewer unless set), or the admin when there are no
 *    accounts at all — the same rule as /setup, so an `OIDC_ONLY` deployment
 *    can bootstrap. Who may get this far is the provider's to decide: a group
 *    restriction on the client is how a deployment limits it.
