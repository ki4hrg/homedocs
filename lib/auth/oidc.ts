 * plain function tested without a provider. This file discovers the issuer,
 * builds the authorization URL and exchanges a code.
 *
 * `openid-client` rather than a hand-rolled flow: verifying an ID token means
 * fetching JWKS, following key rotation, and checking the signature, issuer,
 * audience and nonce — each a place to be subtly wrong in a way that still
 * appears to work. PKCE (S256), `state` and `nonce` are all generated here and
