 * The sign-on round trip's own state: what the callback is checked against,

 * In a cookie rather than a table because it lives for one redirect and belongs
 * to one browser. httpOnly, Secure in production, SameSite=Lax — Lax is what
 * lets it ride the provider's top-level redirect back, and Strict would drop it
 * there. Scoped to the two sign-on routes and gone in ten minutes.
 *
 * Not signed, deliberately: every value in it is either checked against the
 * provider (state, verifier, nonce) or re-validated on the way out (`next`,
 * through safeNext). Somebody editing their own cookie can only break their own
 * sign-in.
