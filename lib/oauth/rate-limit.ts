/*
 * An in-process fixed window.
 *
 * Deliberately not Redis. A single instance is the whole deployment
 * (ARCHITECTURE.md), so a shared store would be infrastructure that exists to
 * coordinate one process with itself — and the thing being protected is a
 * registration endpoint on a personal homelab, not a login form under credential
 * stuffing. 
 *
 * The cost of the fixed window is the boundary burst — 2× the limit across two
 * adjacent windows. That is the right trade here, where the limiter exists to
 * keep a table from growing without bound rather than to shape traffic.
 *
 * Counters live in module state, so they reset when the container does. That is
 * fine and worth saying out loud: a restart forgives an attacker's budget, and
 * the cap on total registered clients is the backstop that does not.
