 * One instance, one writer, so a process-wide pool is the right shape — but it
 * is created on first use rather than at import.
 *
 * `next build` evaluates page modules to collect their metadata, with no
 * DATABASE_URL in the environment; a pool constructed at import time turns every
 * page that reads the catalog into a build failure.
 *
 * The pool hangs off globalThis rather than off module scope, for two reasons
 * that are the same reason. Next re-evaluates modules on hot reload, which leaks
 * connections until Postgres refuses new ones. And a *built* server compiles
 * this file once per layer — six copies in the last build — so a module-level
 * cache is one pool of ten connections per copy, which is how an idle app
 * arrives at sixty. See lib/process-state.ts; this predates that helper and has
 * its own shape, since what it holds is a connection rather than a Map.
